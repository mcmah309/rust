# Panic
***
As with `Error` in Dart Core, `Panic` represents a state that should never happen and thus should never be caught.
Rust vs Dart Error handling terminology:

| Dart Exception Type | Equivalent in Rust |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Exception           | Error              |
| Error               | Panic              |

```dart
Result x = Err(1);
if (x.isErr()) {
  return x.unwrap(); // this will throw a Panic (should be "unwrapErr()")
}
```
panic can also be called directly with
```dart
throw Panic("Panic message here.");
// or 
panic("Panic message here.");
```

rust was designed with safety in mind. The only time rust will ever throw is if you `unwrap` incorrectly (as 
above), in
this case a `Panic`'s can be thrown. But the good news is you can usually avoid using these
methods. See [How to Never Unwrap Incorrectly] section to avoid ever using `unwrap`.

### Unreachable

`Unreachable` is shorthand for a `Panic` where the compiler canâ€™t determine that some code is unreachable.
```dart
throw Unreachable();
// or
unreachable();
```

### Handling Panic

For the most part, a panic is meant to abort your program. Thus one should only try to handle panics 
sparingly, likely only at the root. Use `panicHandler` or `panicHandlerAsync` if this is desired.

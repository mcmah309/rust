# Cell
***
Cell is library of useful wrappers of values (cells) - [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/documentation/rust_core/latest/cell/cell-library.html).

[Cell](#cell) - A wrapper around a mutable value.

[OnceCell](#oncecell) - A cell which can be written to only once.

[LazyCell](#lazycell) - A value which is initialized on the first access.

[LazyCellAsync](#lazycellasync) - A value which is asynchronously initialized on the first access.


## Cell
A wrapper around a mutable value. Useful for mimicking references and wrapping primitives. Extensions exist for 
primitives. e.g. `Cell<int>` can be used similar to a normal `int`.
```dart
final cell = Cell<int>(10);
expect(cell.get(), 10);
cell.add(2);
expect(cell.get(), 12);
final anotherCell = Cell<int>(10);
final newCell = cell + anotherCell;
expect(newCell, 22);
expect(cell, 12);
expect(antherCell, 10);
```
The base type for all `Cell`s is `ConstCell`.

## OnceCell
A cell which can be written to only once. Similar to `late final <variable>`, but will never throw an error.

```dart
final cell = OnceCell<int>();
var result = cell.set(10);
expect(result, const Ok(()));
result = cell.set(20);
expect(result, const Err(20));
```
The base type for all `OnceCell`s is `NullableOnceCell`.

## LazyCell
A value which is initialized on the first access.

```dart
int callCount = 0;
final lazyCell = LazyCell<int>(() {
  callCount++;
  return 20;
});
final firstCall = lazyCell();
expect(callCount, equals(1));
expect(firstCall, equals(20));
final secondCall = lazyCell();
expect(callCount, equals(1));
expect(secondCall, equals(20));
```
The base type for all `LazyCell`s is `NullableLazyCell`.

## LazyCellAsync
A value which is asynchronously initialized on the first access.

```dart
int callCount = 0;
final lazyCell = LazyCellAsync<int>(() async {
  callCount++;
  return 20;
});
final firstCall = await lazyCell.force();
expect(callCount, equals(1));
expect(firstCall, equals(20));
final secondCall = lazyCell(); // Could also call `lazyCell.force()` again.
expect(callCount, equals(1));
expect(secondCall, equals(20));
```
The base type for all `LazyCellAsync`s is `NullableLazyCellAsync`.

## RangeBounds

[RangeBounds](https://pub.dev/documentation/rust/latest/rust/RangeBounds-class.html) works the same as Rust's `RangeBounds` (usually seen as syntactic sugar e.g. `1..=3`) 
They have two uses:
1. `RangeBounds` can be used to get a `Slice` of an `Arr`, `Slice`, or `List`.
```dart
void func(RangeBounds bounds) {
    List<int> list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    Slice<int> slice = list(bounds);
    expect(slice, equals([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]));
}

func(RangeFrom(4));
```
The variants are `Range`, `RangeFrom`, `RangeFull`, `RangeInclusive`, `RangeTo`, and `RangeToInclusive`.

2. `RangeBounds` that also implement `IterableRangeBounds` can be iterated over as a generator.
```dart
for(int x in Range(5, 10)){ // 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    // code
}
```
All  `RangeBounds` can be `const`.
### `range` Function

`range` is a convenience function that works the same as the python `range` function. As opposed to the `RangeBounds` classes, the range function can have negative ranges and varying step sizes.
```dart
range(end); // == range(0,end);
range(start, end);
range(start, end, step);

for(final x in range(0, 10, 1)){}
// equivalent to
for(final x in range(10)){}
```
Note `Arr.range(..)` also exists as a more efficient method for when it is known collecting the range is needed.
